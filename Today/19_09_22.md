# Istio in Action

## Introducing Istio Service Mesh

### Intro
- building resilience into application -> can't ignore `network`
  - resilience
    - retry
    - timeout
    - circuit breaker
- 시스템이 커지고 분산시스템이 될수록 `network`는 application에서 핵심 디자인 요소가 되어야 한다.
- Application resilience, observability, traffic control, security, policy r 'horizontal concern' -> not the application itself
- `Service Mesh`
  - decentralized application-networking infrastructure -> application to be resilient, secure, observable, controllable
  - architecture
    - control plan: manage proxies
    - data plan: application-level proxies to manage the networking traffic
      - base on Envoy proxy
      - live alongside the application
